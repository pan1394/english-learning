being的用法小结（摘）句子中的being是不能随便去掉的，在句子中出现being的情况大致分为以下几种：
一，being用作现在分词用法。
（1）一种用作现在分词，是强调正在进行，尤其是在被动语态中的使用，这个时候，being只是一个描述进行时态的符号，
如，The trees are being planted,这种用法比较简单，我们也很好分辨。
（2）用作现在分词的时候.being用于作定语中，一般和过去分词连用，放在被说明名词后，表示进行时被动意义：
The house being built will be our new laboratory.
（3）being用于状语，一般有逗号，翻译时常加表示状语的词汇，如“由于……”、“……时”等：
Being very tiny, aunts can not often be seen byus.
（4）还有一种现在分词的用法，是用作独立分词结构，含蓄的表示各种状态：
1.There are a large number of different shapes of files, each being made for some particular kind of work.
（伴随情况）各种锉刀的形状大不相同，每一种都是为特殊的一类加工而制作的。
2.The resistance being very high, the current in the circuit is low.
（条件状语）如果电阻很大，则电路内电流就小。
