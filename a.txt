You're chatty, social kind of person, aren't you?
Well yes, I think so.
But, would you go upto a stranger and straight up a conversion?
That might be going too far. If you don't know them, what're you going to start talking about?
That is a good question. But maybe you should. Because in this program, we're looking at how talking
to a stranger might actually be good for you.
But first let me talk to you about today's question
I'd like to you to answer this, To make a conversion, you need words.
So according to Oxford English Dictionary, Approximately how many words are using in English language?
A. 171, 146
B. 271, 146
C. 371, 146
We use a lot words in english, but not 371, 000. So I go for A, 171, 146.
So we always reveal the answer later in the program.
Now let's continue our conversion about having a conversion with strangers.
Many of us spend part of every day surround by strangers, with our work, sitting in a cafe or a park, or visiting
a supermarket.
But we rarely re-chat and talk to them, because we fear and it makes us spofeel, uncomfortable or awkward.
